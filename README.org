#+TITLE: prefix-quick-calc

Provides =prefix-quick-calc=, which is like =quick-calc= but uses prefix
notation. Only supports =+=, =-=, =*=, and =/=.

=prefix-quick-calc= converts the expression entered into an s-expression that is
then passed to =eval=. So

#+begin_example
+ 1 2 - 3 4 5
#+end_example

becomes

#+begin_example
(+ 1 2 (- 3 4 5))
#+end_example
