#+TITLE: prefix-calc

Provides =prefix-calc=, which is like =quick-calc= but uses prefix
notation. Only supports =+=, =-=, =*=, and =/=.

=prefix-calc= converts the expression entered into an s-expression that is
then passed to =eval=. So

#+begin_example
+ 1 2 - 3 4 5
#+end_example

becomes

#+begin_example
(+ 1 2 (- 3 4 5))
#+end_example

Using the prefix argument will insert the result into the existing buffer at
point.

When highlighting a region that's also a valid prefix-calc expression,
=prefix-calc-on-region= will replace the current region with the result of the
expression.
